# vocab4devs
An English Tech vocabulary database gathered by Ingl√©s para Devs community

## this my happy contribution to the community
the file "Vocabulario4Devs-RawData.tsv" has the content of the notion vocabulary page. the columns are separated by "@@", hopfully this will help to build the final version of this unvaluable resource for the community.
